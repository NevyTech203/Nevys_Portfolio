My name is Nevena Young, but I prefer to be called Nevy. I aspire to build a career as a computer scientist within the space industry. In the short term, I aim to work at AWS as a Solutions Architect to gain valuable industry experience while pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in computer science. My passion for technology began in childhood through gaming consoles, and my fascination with space was sparked by a deep curiosity about the universe. Ultimately, I am committed to building a career that aligns with both my interests and passions, one that is both meaningful and fulfilling.
