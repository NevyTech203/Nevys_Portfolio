My name is Nevena Young, but I prefer to be called Nevy. I am fascinated with technology, and I aspire to build a career as a computer scientist within the space industry. In the short term, I aim to work at AWS as a Solutions Architect to gain valuable industry experience while pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in computer science. My passion for technology began in childhood through gaming consoles, and my fascination with space was sparked by a deep curiosity about the universe. Ultimately, I am committed to building a career that aligns with both my interests and passions, one that is both meaningful and fulfilling.

The enhanced code is a C++ program developed for an OpenGL-based 3D graphics project, created as part of a computer graphics and visualization assignment. I first completed this artifact in 2022, but I enhanced it in 2025. It uses modern OpenGL practices to render a texture, lit 3D cube with dynamic lighting and camera controls. The code demonstrates the use of vertex and fragment shaders, texture mapping, Phong lighting, and user interactivity through keyboard and mouse input.
